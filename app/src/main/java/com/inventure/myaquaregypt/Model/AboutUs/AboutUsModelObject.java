     * text : If you feel a cold coming on, doctors recommend soaking in Epsom salt to help your body rest, recover and detoxify. Dr. Theresa Ramsey, cofounder of the Center for Natural Healing in Arizona, says that soaking in Epsom salt helps spur a process called vasodilation, which increases white blood cell production and helps the body fight illnesses quicker. Dr. Margaret Philhower says that the magnesium in Epsom salt also helps to relax muscles and alleviate body aches. Dr. Mao, a 38th-generation doctor of Chinese medicine, says that the sulfur in Epsom salt helps kill bacteria and fungus.
